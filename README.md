# Task Manager Web App

This is a small website to create, edit and delete tasks.

You can:

- Add a new task
- Edit a task
- Delete a task
- Save tasks in your browser (local storage)

There is also a simple page to register a new user with:

- Username
- Password
- Confirm password
- Age

The design is simple and easy to use.

## How to use

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. Write your task and click "Add".
3. If you close the page, your tasks are still there (saved in your browser).

## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

This project is for learning how to work with the DOM and save data in the browser.
